/* PEEPS, DISCOVER THE JOY OF SUCH A CLEAN AND SEXY CODE (you can notify me all aberration you find if you want, i am genuinely curious and willing to learn)

Welcome to the machine:

No need to remind you that this is a SPOILER ZONE, don't read it if you don't want to get spoiled

To add:
-obviously, more absurd stories and more endings
-salt
-more passive aggressive
-disgusting jokes
-more cookies
-more minigames
-saving system
-more jokes in source CODE
-more music references
-secret routes
-tree
-juiciness

To avoid:
-becoming homestuck
-death
-typos (help)

Update Log:
(7/26/2023) V1: Did the first version of the game in a few hours out of despair, with pretty drawings made with the mouse
(7/27/2023) V2: Continued the get out of bed "storyline" and added more succulent jokes (and pretty drawings made with the mouse)
(7/28/2023) V3: Added Cookie Clicker, Minecraft and a secret ending
