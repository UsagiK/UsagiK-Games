/* PEEPS, DISCOVER THE JOY OF SUCH A CLEAN AND SEXY CODE (you can notify me all aberration you find if you want, i am genuinely curious and willing to learn)

Welcome to the machine:

No need to remind you that this is a SPOILER ZONE, don't read it if you don't want to get spoiled

To add:
-obviously, more absurd stories and more endings
-salt
-passive aggressive comments if the game remember you didn't wash your hands
-disgusting jokes
-cookie clicker (i'm legit, that and other minigames hidden at some pages)
-saving system
-more jokes in source CODE

To avoid:
-becoming homestuck
-death

Update Log:
(7/26/2023) V1: did the first version of the game in a few hours out of despair, with pretty drawings made with the mouse
(7/27/2023) V2: continued the get out of bed "storyline" and added more succulent jokes (and pretty drawings made with the mouse
